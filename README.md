# üì™ Reddit Mailbox

Browse reddit while looking like you're reading your email

Thanks for the immense support from reddit! This project became the most popular post on r/coding of 2022 in a day (somehow?!) We've also received over 100,000 views to the site in one day!

I'll continue to add new features. Feel free to contribute if you can, there's still so many features to add and things to tweak and improve

## üìå How to use?
1. Go to https://one-loop.github.io/redlookit
2. You will automatically get the posts from /popular after a second or two in the main area.
3. If you want to view posts from a specific subreddit, type the name of the subreddit in the search bar and hit enter. Then click on the subreddit button under the "your subreddits" section in the sidebar which will get the posts from that subreddit and display it in the email area
4. Clicking on a post will expand it to the right where you can read comments
